# evaluation-of-transfer-evidence
A template model (Bayes net) for the evaluation of transfer evidence at activity level. The template model is a generalization of the template model presented by Taylor et al. (2018) for constructing Bayesian networks in forensic biology cases when considering activity level propositions. It also incorporates the ideas in Kokshoorn et al. (2017) on propositions disputing the actor or activity in DNA evidence evaluation. The template model illustrates the evaluation of transfer evidence regarding item Z by modeling the different possible pathways between trace deposition and the case findings on Z.
